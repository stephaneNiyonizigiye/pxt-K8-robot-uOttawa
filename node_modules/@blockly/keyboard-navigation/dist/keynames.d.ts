 * Key names for common characters. These should be used with keyup/keydown
 * events, since the .keyCode property on those is meant to indicate the
 * _physical key_ the user held down on the keyboard. Hence the mapping uses
 * only the unshifted version of each key (e.g. no '#', since that's shift+3).
 * Keypress events on the other hand generate (mostly) ASCII codes since they
 * correspond to *characters* the user typed.

 *
 * This list is not localized and therefore some of the key codes are not
 * correct for non-US keyboard layouts.
